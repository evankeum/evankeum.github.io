			About Me
			</div>
			<div id="about-text">
			<div id="text1">
			I am a UC Berkeley Student studying Environmental Sciences. 
			</div>
			<div id="text2">
			I guess that's the first thing people say when they introduce themselves. Their job or their education. But to better present myself, I will start by saying I am from Korea and I came here to the States in 2003 and lived in Glendale all throughout my childhood until I came to the bay area to continue my higher education.
			</div>
			I am studying the environment, not because I am fanatic about trees, but because I find the environment, more specifically the animals and the energy within it super fascinating. I also enjoy being in front of my computer which is shown by my trademark black glasses, and I do a wide variety of things; from researching which show is good to watch on Netflix to watching quality shows on Netflix. Oh, I also like to browse Reddit and code sometimes. I am not the best, but I love fiddling around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have pretty good exposure. I am also pretty decent with Python and Java, and have a tiny bit of experience with SQL and Scheme.
			<div id="text3">
			There are a few things I'm very passionate about. I love playing tennis(I would just put that I was a Doubles MVP here *cough* *cough*), I enjoy playing LOL(if you know what that stands for add me:GoldenBear17) and binge watching TV shows on Netflix, I love insects and animals, and I love helping people. From the said things, I could only incorporate the last two into my career. I am interested in consulting or just helping the environment with what I can with the skills I have.
			</div>
			For now, or at least for the upcoming summer, I will be working for <a href="http://www.pge.com/" target="_blank">PG & E.</a> as a Planning Analyst Intern where I will be helping people plan environmental projects and help out with some website management. 
			<div id="text4">
			If you need some help with something environmental related or computer related, I'm your guy!

					</div>
					<div id="experience1info">
					I was part of the Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program where I helped carefully classify the different orders of arthropods within a cluster containing up to 25 different almost "microscopic" arthropods using a microscope and a handbook. I had to differentiate them according to the number of limbs, and other body structures. The goal of the research was to develop metrics of diversity and abundance over extended time and provide insights into biodiversity assembly dynamics to the different Hawaiian arthropods over geological chronosequence.

							Undergraduate Student Instructor & Organic Chemistry Lab Student Scholar
						</div>
						<div id="experience2info">
							Even though I hate Chemistry with all my heart(hate is a strong word, but an adequate one for this context), I worked as a lab assistant for an organic chemistry lab to teach the lab students different organic chemistry concepts and help them with general laboratory troubleshooting. It gave me a chance not only to help people, but expose myself to more lab work.

					Publisher | Class Facilitator
					</div>
					<div id="experience3info">
					I was part of the general executive staff of the largest Christian Journal in UC Berkeley campus, and I was in charge of the publicity of the journal, and my job was to strategically update the Facebook page as well as the Journal website to gain more publicity. This journal also has a class along with the club that publishes the journal, and I was in charge of over 40 UC Berkeley students every semester where I taught them the different tools and techniques such as InDesign, editing skills, writing skills, and poetry writings for a registered UC Berkeley course.

					Social Chair
					</div>
					<div id="experience4info">
					I also worked for a year as the social chair for Korean American Student Association (KASA), the largest Korean American association in campus. I served as a family head for a smaller group with about 20 people within the massively large club to form a smaller close-knit community for students who were seeking a family like community. I also worked to strategically plan out events to maximize the small budget given to provide social, and welcoming environments.
